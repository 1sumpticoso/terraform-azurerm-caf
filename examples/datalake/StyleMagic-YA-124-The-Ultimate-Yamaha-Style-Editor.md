How to use StyleMagic YA 1.2.4
 
Using StyleMagic YA 1.2.4 is very simple and intuitive. You can start by opening an existing style file or creating a new one from scratch. You can choose the format and model of your style, as well as the number of sections and variations. You can also set the tempo, time signature, and key signature of your style.
 
Once you have your style file ready, you can switch to the SMF editor or the CASM editor, depending on what type of data you want to edit. The SMF editor lets you edit the musical notes and events of your style, using a piano roll or a notation view. You can add, delete, move, copy, paste, transpose, quantize, and modify the notes and events of your style, as well as change the voice, volume, pan, reverb, chorus, and DSP effects for each track. You can also use various tools and functions to make your editing process easier, such as chord recognition, groove quantize, drum map, mixer, and more.
 
The CASM editor lets you edit the style parameters and settings of your style, using a tabbed interface that shows different categories of CASM data. You can edit the NTR (Note Transposition Rule), NTT (Note Transposition Table), OTS (One Touch Setting), PCG (Program Change Group), RTR (Rhythm Track Rule), SFF (Style File Format), and VCE (Voice) parameters of your style. You can also edit the CASM parameters in SFF GE format if your style supports it. You can change the voice type, octave shift, velocity shift, note limit range, chord detect range, chord fingered type, chord note on/off type, and more for each track and section of your style.
 
When you are done editing your style data, you can save your style file in the same or a different format and model. You can also export your style as a MIDI file or import a MIDI file as a style. You can also use the built-in player to preview and test your style before saving it. You can play along with your style using a keyboard connected to your computer via MIDI or USB. You can also change the tempo, key signature, chord type, and variation of your style while playing it.
